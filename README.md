# Final CSS Project: Copy Cat

PROMPT: Create a replica of a website using HTML and CSS, but heavily CSS

SKILLS USED: HTML, CSS, GitHub, VSCode, Bootstrap

PROCESS:
- I used the Google page as my copy cat because I only had 3 days to complete the project and I wanted to be done within the allocated time
- I planned out the framework on paper to draft out how I'm going to code this out
- I programmed the code using HTML as a layout and CSS for the decorations
- I also added in Bootsrap add-ons to make the replica somewhat interactive

OUTPUT:
- An almost perfect replica of the Google page
- The picture redirects to the actual google doodle page
- the buttons are clickable, but they don't redirect to anywhere
- The search bar is functional for typing in any input
